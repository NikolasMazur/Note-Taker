## Usage
Open the application site and either run the command `node server.js` to start a local instance of the site on port 3001 or visit the Heroku deployed site at ()(Heroku deployment may take a while to start up initially). After getting on the application you can type notes and press the 'save' icon on the upper right of the window.
